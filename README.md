# Samples for the PDF Services .NET SDK

This sample solution helps you get started with the PDF Services .NET SDK.

The sample projects illustrate how to perform PDF-related actions (such as converting to and from the PDF format) using the PDF Services .NET SDK. **Please note that the PDF Services .NET SDK supports only server side use cases**.

## Prerequisites
The sample solution has the following requirements:
* .NET: version 8.0 or above
* Build Tool: The solution requires Visual studio or .NET Core CLI to be installed to be able to run the sample projects.

## Authentication Setup
The credentials file for the samples is ```pdfservices-api-credentials.json```.
Before the samples can be run, set the environment variables `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID` and `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET` from the `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` file downloaded at the end of creation of credentials via [Get Started](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/gettingstarted.html?ref=getStartedWithServicesSdk) workflow by running the following commands :

1. For MacOS/Linux Users :
```$xlst
export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>
export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>
```

2. For Windows Users :
```$xlst
set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>
set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>
```

## Client Configurations

The SDK supports setting up custom timeout for the API calls. Please
refer this [section](#create-a-pdf-file-from-a-docx-file-by-providing-custom-value-for-timeouts) to
know more.

The SDK also supports setting up Proxy Server configurations which helps in successful API calls for network where all outgoing calls have to go through a proxy else, they are blocked. Please
refer this [section](#create-a-pdf-file-from-a-docx-file-by-providing-proxy-server-settings) to
know more.

Additionally, SDK can be configured to process the documents in the specified region.
Please refer this [section](#export-a-pdf-file-to-a-docx-file-by-providing-the-region) to know more.

## Quota Exhaustion
If you receive ServiceUsageException during the Samples run, it means that trial credentials have exhausted their usage quota. Please [contact us](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_requestform) to get paid credentials.

## Build with .NET Core CLI
Run the following command to build the project:
```$xslt
dotnet build
```

Note that the PDF Services SDK is listed as a dependency and will be downloaded automatically.

## A Note on Logging
Following component is being used by SDK:
* [LibLog](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog) (MIT) as bridge between different logging frameworks.

Log4net is used as a logging provider in the sample projects and the logging configurations are provided in ```log4net.config```.

**Note**: Add the configuration for your preferred provider and set up the necessary appender as required for logging to work.

## Running the samples
The following sub-sections describe how to run the samples. Prior to running the samples, check that the configuration file is set up as described above and that the project has been built.

The code is in the different sample projects under the solution folder. Test files used by the samples can be found in the project directory itself. When executed, all samples create an ```output```
child folder under the working directory to store their results.
